Mix-norm and hypergraphs for study of mixing in 2d flows
based on the paper "Spectral analysis of mixing in  2D high-Reynolds flows" by H. Arbabi and I. Mezic

## flow data for the paper

All the above code are done for the steady flow at Re=1000 in cavity flow. For computing the figures in the paper you need the data corresponding to the flow
